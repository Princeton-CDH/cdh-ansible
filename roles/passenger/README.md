# Passenger

Borrowed from [pulibrary / princeton_ansible](https://github.com/pulibrary/princeton_ansible/tree/main/roles/passenger), who originally borrowed from Geerling Guy.

Installs Passenger (with Nginx) Ubuntu linux servers, with configuration
to serve wsgi application.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Application name variable ``app_name`` must be defined.

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    passenger_server_name: www.example.com

The server name (used in the Nginx virtual host configuration).

    passenger_app_root: /var/www/app

The wsgi file to use and the path to the python to use (i.e., if you need python within a virtualenv):
    
    passenger_startup_file: app/wsgi.py
    passenger_python: /usr/bin/python


Values for passenger configuration directives inside `nginx.conf`. These defaults should generally work correctly.

    nginx_worker_processes: "{{ ansible_processor_vcpus | default(ansible_processor_count) }}"
    nginx_worker_connections: "768"
    nginx_keepalive_timeout: "65"
    nginx_remove_default_vhost: true
