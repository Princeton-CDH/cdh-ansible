###
# This role finalizes the staging VM for use to verify functionality manually
# in Vagrant.
#
# Its main purpose currently is to install a super user with a password since
# Princeton CAS does not work correctly when run through Apache on Vagrant
# (the server does not report its IP as 'localhost' or a princeton.edu domain
# and therefore fails to validate).
###
