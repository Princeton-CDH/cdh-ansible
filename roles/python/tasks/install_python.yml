# Install a specified version of python. Uses a repository that provides newer
# versions of python, since Ubuntu doesn't (deadsnakes).
# 
# Note that Ubuntu splits up core python libraries into many packages; most are
# required to create the venv. Contents may differ depending on the version of
# python – for example, python3.8-distutils falls back to python3-distutils.
# 
# We include the generic python3-setuptools because it's required to create the
# virtual environment; later we can update pip and setuptools inside it.
