###
# Run webpack to compile static assets (css and javascript).
#
# This role runs Webpack to compile and compress source javascript and styles
# into css/js files. It depends on webpack and all its associated js dependencies
# having been installed, usually through the 'build_npm' role.
# 
# The role expects that appropriate qa/prod-specific tasks will be defined in
# package.json and callable via `npm run build:qa` and `npm run build:prod`.
