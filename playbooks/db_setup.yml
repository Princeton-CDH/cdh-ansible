# Run database setup and update application local settings.
# The application must already be deployed.
#
# Use this playbook for database migrations to do database setup
# (create new database and db user, ensure app server has access),
# and then update the local settings to reference the new database.
#
# For proper behavior, you MUST specify setup and app_config tags
# and skip db_backup:
#
#    ansible-playbook playbooks/db_setup.yml -t setup,app_config
#
# Use the --limit option to run on a single host or host group.
